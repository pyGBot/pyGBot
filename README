Simple Disclaimer:
THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. It it provided AS-IS, with no warranty or support.
If it breaks your computer, it's not our fault.

Requirements:
 - Python >= 2.5
 - Twisted >= 2.0 (including twisted.words)

To run:
Uncompress, go to src/ and modify the values in pyGBot.ini. The main ones
you're interested in are host, port, nick, and channel. Once that's done, run
pyGBot.py.

To add users to the Auth system:
Run hashpw.py, it will prompt you for the relevant details.

To modify:
Your best bet is to look at the existing plugins, as well as src/BasePlugin.py.
All plugins must subclass BasePlugin. If you design a new plugin, you'll have
to add it to the list of plugins to be loaded and started in pyGBot.ini.
[Plugins] is plugins to load, and [Plugins.system.Startup] is plugins which
will be activated immediately.

Command system:
The system.Commands plugin provides a set of commands (extensible of course!)
which are single-line calls made by users to enact some immediate response or
action. The existing ones are primarily related to controlling the bot (join /
part channel, send public message, etc) but any single-line command could
conceivably be implemented here. Have a look at the existing commands in
src/Plugins/system/CommandSpec, and the BaseCommand class in
src/Plugins/system/Commands.py.

If you have any further questions please respond via email or the forums, both
can be found at the project page:

Enjoy!
