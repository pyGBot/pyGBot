Modify pytbot.ini to point to the  IRC server you want to use.

All dealer commands are of the form 'p cmd [arg1 [arg2]]'.  'p help'
gives a list of most commands.  ***Please note that many IRC servers
using flood protection will kick pytbot if users ask for help (or even
if the game is moving quickly!).  It works best if you can get an
admin of the server to turn off flood protection for the bot.***
